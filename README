A simple test runner with testing asynchronous testing in mind.

Some goals of the project:

+ I want it to be simple.  You create a test and then run the code you want to
  test and make assertions as you go along.  Tests should be functions.
+ I want to use the assertion module that comes with Node. So, if you are 
  familiar with those you won't have any problems.  You shouldn't have to learn
  new assertion functions.  
+ I want test files to be executable by themselves.  So, if your test file is
  called "my_test_file.js" then "node my_test_file.js" should run the tests.
+ Address the issue of testing asynchronouse code.  Node is asynchronous, so
  testing should be too.
+ I don't want another behavior driven development testing framework. I don't
  like specifications and what not. They only add verbosity. 
  
      test('X does Y',function() {
        //test goes here
      });

  is good enough for me.
+ I'd like it to be as general as possible so you can test anything.

------------------------------------------------------------

The hard part of writing a test suite for asynchronous code is that when a test
fails, you don't know which test it was that failed.

This module aims to address that issue by giving each test its own unique assert
object. That way you know which assertions correspond to which tests.

    test('my test name', function(test) {
      test.assert.ok(true);
    });

Because you don't know how long the asynchronous code is going to take, no
results are printed about the tests until the process exits and we know all the
tests are finished. It would be confusing to be printing the results of tests
willy nilly.  This way, you get the results in the order that the tests are 
written in the file.

The output looks something like this:

    Starting test "this does something" ...
    Starting test "this doesn't fail" ...
    Starting test "this does something else" ...
    Starting test "this fails" ...
    Starting test "throws" ...
    
    Results:
    ...F.
    
    test "this fails" failed: AssertionError: true == false
        at [object Object].ok (/path/to/node-asyncTesting/asyncTesting.js:21:29)
        at Timer.<anonymous> (/path/to/node-simpletests/testsExample.js:25:25)
        at node.js:988:1
        at node.js:992:1

There is also a TestSuite object:

    var ts = new TestSuite('Name');
    ts.setup = function() {
      this.foo = 'bar';
    }
    ts.runTests({
        "foo equals bar": function(test) {
          test.assert.equal('bar', test.foo);
        }
      });

The setup function is ran once for each test.  You can also add a
teardown function:

    var ts = new TestSuite('Name');
    ts.teardown = function() {
      this.foo = null;
    }

Tests suites output a little more information:

> Starting tests for "Name"
> Starting test "foo equals bar" ...
> 
> Ran suite "Name"
> .
> 1 test; 0 failures; 1 assertion 

There is a convenience method so if you do know when the test is finished you 
can call `test.finish()`.  Then if all the tests in the suite are done it will
immediately output as opposed to waiting for the process to exit.  Currently,
only test suites are able to take advantage of this because they know exactly
how many tests exist.

    (new TestSuite()).runTests({
        "foo equals bar": function(test) {
          test.assert.equal('bar', test.foo);
          test.finish();
        }
      });

Additionally, if the order of the tests does matter, you can tell the TestSuite
to wait for each test to finish before starting the next one.  This requires you
to use the aforementioned function to explicitly indicate when the test
is finished.

    var count = 0;
    var ts = new TestSuite('Wait');
    ts.wait = true;
    ts.runTests({
        "count equal 0": function(test) {
          test.assert.equal(0, count);
          setTimeout(function() {
            count++;
            test.finish();
            }, 50);
        },
        "count equal 1": function(test) {
          test.assert.equal(1, count);
          test.finish();
        }
      });

Finally, if you want to be explicit about the number of assertions run in a
given test, you can set `numAssertionsExpected` on the test. This can be helpful
in asynchronous tests where you want to be sure all the assertions are ran.

    test('my test name', function(test) {
      test.numAssertionsExpected = 3;
      test.assert.ok(true);
      // this test will fail
    });

Currently there is no way to know when an error is thrown which test it came
from (note, I am not referring to failures here but unexpected errors).  This
could be addressed if you require all async code to be in Promises
or smething similar (like Spectacular http://github.com/jcrosby/spectacular
does), but I am not ready to make that requirement right now. If I say
setTimeout(func, 500); and that function throws an error, there is no way for me
to know which test it corresponds to. So, currently, if an error is thrown, the
TestSuite or file exits there.
