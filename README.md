node-async-testing
==================

The node-async-testing project is no longer maintained.  Perhaps you should take a
look at [asynct](https://github.com/dominictarr/asynct) or [node-unit](https://github.com/caolan/nodeunit).

The author of this project feels that testing frameworks like this are inherently
flawed in an async environment.  They depend on your tests working how you expect
them to, but the whole point of a testing framework is that you catch things you
don't expect.

I do have some ideas for addressing this, but until that time, node-async-testing
will have to wait...
